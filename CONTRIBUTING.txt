We'd love contributions.  It takes a village to raise a trol.  

If you contribute, you must include your name (or whatever you'd like to be
identified by) -- and optionally, contact info -- in this file, and by so
doing, you grant a non-exclusive, perpetual, world-wide, irrevocable,
no-charge, royalty-free copyright license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative
works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute all
contributions you have made to this project.

This is a license agreement only; it does not transfer copyright ownership and
does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other
purpose.
